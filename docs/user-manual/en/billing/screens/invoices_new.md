# New invoice

Form to create a **free** invoice (without a budget). On save the
invoice is born as a draft (`draft`) and the
[detail](./invoices_id.md) opens so you can issue it when ready.

To invoice from an accepted budget use the
[budget-based screen](./invoices_from-budget_budgetId.md) — it
copies items with their price and VAT snapshots and avoids data
entry errors.

## At a glance

- **Receiver.** Defaults to the patient. *Different payer* lets you
  point to a third party (company, insurer, family member) with
  their own fiscal data.
- **Free lines.** Add catalog items with quantity, discount, VAT.
  You can also add manual lines (no catalog item) when needed for
  special charges.
- **No issuing yet.** Creating does not issue: it only saves the
  draft. Issuance lives on the detail.
- **Numbering.** Not assigned here; the fiscal number is set only
  when you **issue** (button on the detail), which takes the next
  one from the active series.

## Create a free invoice

> Requires `billing.write`.

1. Pick the patient. If the invoice is for a different payer,
   click *Different payer* and fill in tax ID, name, and fiscal
   address.
2. Add lines: catalog item, quantity, discount, VAT.
3. Review totals (subtotal, discount, VAT, total).
4. **Save**. The invoice is born in `draft`. To issue, open the
   [detail](./invoices_id.md) and click **Issue**.

## Permissions

| What you see / can do | Permission |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Access the form | `billing.read` |
| Create a draft | `billing.write` |

## Troubleshooting

- **"No active series" warning.** No series is marked active for
  the fiscal year under *Settings → Invoice series*. You can save
  the draft but not issue it.
- **Cannot find a catalog item.** Make sure it is active and that
  your role has `catalog.read`. If you need a special charge, add
  a manual line.
- **No *Different payer* button.** Available on any draft (no
  extra permission). If it doesn't show, refresh; it may be a
  load failure of the catalog or the clinic settings.
