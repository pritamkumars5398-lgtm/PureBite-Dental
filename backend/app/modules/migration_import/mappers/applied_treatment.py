"""Map ``applied_treatment`` → :class:`treatment_plan.PlannedTreatmentItem`.

DPMF's ``applied_treatment`` row is the clinical event: a patient
underwent (or is scheduled to undergo) a specific catalog entry. In
DentalPin this requires three rows in cooperation:

1. **One ``TreatmentPlan`` per (patient, source budget)**. Gesdén
   organises clinical activity around budgets; piling 100+ items
   into a single per-patient plan makes the UI unreadable. The
   mapper resolves ``applied_treatment.budget_line_uuid`` → its
   ``BudgetItem.budget_id`` and creates a plan titled after the
   source budget number ("Migrado — PRES-2024-0007"). Applied
   treatments without a budget link land in a "Migrado — sin
   presupuesto" catch-all per patient.
2. **One ``odontogram.Treatment``** for the actual tooth treatment
   record. ``clinical_type`` is derived from the raw Gesdén
   ``IdTipoOdg`` code via ``_TIPO_ODG_TO_CLINICAL_TYPE`` so the UI
   shows real names ("filling_composite", "implant", "crown" …)
   instead of every row landing as the catch-all "migrated". The
   catalog item is also linked so the imported budget/treatment
   inherits the destination catalog's pricing strategy and labels.
3. **One ``PlannedTreatmentItem``** linking the plan and the
   treatment.

The ``applied_treatment_phase`` mapper attaches sessions to the
``PlannedTreatmentItem`` produced here.
