# Treatment plan module

Patient treatment plans with budget + odontogram sync. **Heaviest
`depends` in the system** — this module is an integration hub. Read
this file before changing any cross-module flow.

## State machine

```
draft ──confirm──► pending ──accept──► active ──complete──► completed
  ▲                  │                    │
  │                  │ rejected/expired   │ cancelled by clinic
  │                  ▼                    ▼
  └─── reactivate ◄──────  closed  ◄─────┘
                       (closure_reason)
```

`closure_reason` ∈ `{rejected_by_patient, expired,
cancelled_by_clinic, patient_abandoned, other}`. See ADR 0006 and
`docs/workflows/plan-budget-flow.md` (staff manual).

## Public API

Routes mounted at `/api/v1/treatment-plans/`.

- `GET   /treatment-plans`              — list; `treatment_plan.plans.read`
- `POST  /treatment-plans`              — create; `treatment_plan.plans.write`
- `GET   /treatment-plans/{id}`         — detail
- `PUT   /treatment-plans/{id}`         — update; status transitions
- `POST  /treatment-plans/{id}/items`   — add item from catalog or odontogram tooth treatment
- `PUT   /treatment-plans/{id}/items/reorder`
- `POST  /treatment-plans/{id}/items/{item_id}/complete`
- `POST  /treatment-plans/{id}/confirm`     — `plans.confirm`; draft → pending
- `POST  /treatment-plans/{id}/reopen`      — pending → draft, cancels linked budget
- `POST  /treatment-plans/{id}/close`       — `plans.close`; any → closed
- `POST  /treatment-plans/{id}/reactivate`  — `plans.reactivate`; closed → draft
- `POST  /treatment-plans/{id}/contact-log` — record reception touchpoint
- `GET   /treatment-plans/pipeline`         — bandeja (5 tabs)

> **Notes endpoints moved.** Since issue #60 the `clinical_notes` module
> owns every clinical-note CRUD path (`/api/v1/clinical_notes/*`). The
> per-item completion endpoint here no longer accepts `note_body` — the
> client orchestrates a follow-up POST to `clinical_notes` when the
> dentist captures a note at completion time.

## Dependencies

`manifest.depends = ["patients", "agenda", "odontogram", "catalog", "budget", "media"]`.
Six dependencies. Anything not on this list is off-limits — no imports,
no FKs.

## Permissions

`treatment_plan.plans.{read,write}`. Clinical-note permissions live in
the `clinical_notes` module since issue #60.

## Events emitted

| Event | When | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `treatment_plan.created` | plan created | consumed by `patient_timeline` |
| `treatment_plan.status_changed` | status transition | currently no subscribers |
| `treatment_plan.confirmed` | draft → pending | snapshot payload (items, totals, patient). Subscriber: `patient_timeline`. |
| `treatment_plan.closed` | any → closed | payload includes `closure_reason`. Subscriber: `patient_timeline`. |
| `treatment_plan.reactivated` | closed → draft | Subscriber: `patient_timeline`. |
| `treatment_plan.treatment_added` | item added | snapshot payload (catalog_item_id, tooth, surfaces, unit_price, budget_id). Subscriber: `budget`. |
| `treatment_plan.treatment_removed` | item removed | payload includes `budget_id`. Subscriber: `budget`. |
| `treatment_plan.treatment_completed` | item marked done | consumed by `patient_timeline`, `recalls`. Payload includes `treatment_category_key` (snapshot, may be null) so subscribers can map a completed treatment to a follow-up policy without importing catalog or treatment_plan models (issue #62). Earned-ledger generation **moved out** of this event since the multi-session feature — see `item_session_completed` below. |
| `treatment_plan.item_session_completed` | one session of a multi-session item marked done | payload: `{plan_id, item_id, session_id, sequence, label, amount, treatment_id, patient_id, completed_by, occurred_at}`. Consumed by `payments` (earned entry, idempotent on `(treatment_id, session_id)`). Fires for every completed session — single-session items publish it once on completion. |
| `treatment_plan.budget_sync_requested` | manual resync | snapshot payload includes full `items[]`. Subscriber: `budget`. |
| `treatment_plan.item_completed_without_note` | completion check | consumed by `patient_timeline` |

Clinical-note created events (`clinical_notes.{administrative,diagnosis,treatment,plan}_created`) live in the `clinical_notes` module.

> All events above are declared in `EventType` and published via the
> constants. ``items_reordered`` used to be a string-only literal —
> it now lives at `EventType.TREATMENT_PLAN_ITEMS_REORDERED`.

## Events consumed

| Event | Handler | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `appointment.completed`         | `on_appointment_completed`  | mark planned items as performed if linked |
| `budget.accepted`               | `on_budget_accepted`        | pending → active (idempotent) |
| `budget.rejected`               | `on_budget_rejected`        | pending → closed (closure_reason=rejected_by_patient) |
| `budget.renegotiated`           | `on_budget_renegotiated`    | pending → draft (budget already cancelled by publisher) |
| `odontogram.treatment.performed` | `on_treatment_performed`   | mark planned item completed when its tooth treatment is performed |

## Lifecycle

- `removable=False`. Plans tie patients ↔ budgets ↔ tooth treatments;
  removing the module would orphan all three.

## Gotchas

- **Plan → budget direct call is the carve-out.** `confirm()` calls
  `BudgetService.create_from_plan_snapshot` synchronously to keep the
  draft-budget creation transactional with the state transition.
  Allowed because `budget` is in `manifest.depends`. Item-level
  add/remove sync remains event-driven (the snapshot payloads carry
  enough data so `budget` doesn't import treatment_plan).
- **Plan ↔ budget item sync goes through events**, not direct calls.
  Adding a treatment to a plan publishes
  `treatment_plan.treatment_added` with a denormalized snapshot
  (catalog_item_id, tooth, surfaces, unit_price, budget_id); the
  budget module's handler creates the matching budget line.
- **Item completion has two paths**: the user marks an item complete
  here, or the odontogram fires `odontogram.treatment.performed`. Both
  must converge to the same state — keep them idempotent.
- **Sessions are the source of earned signal.** Every plan item now
  owns ≥1 `PlannedTreatmentItemSession` (backfilled by `tp_0006`).
  Per-session completion fires `item_session_completed`; the item
  finalizes (and `treatment_completed` fires) only when every session
  is in a terminal state and at least one is `completed`. Editing a
  completed session is refused — its amount is the snapshot that
  payments already booked.
- **Completion still emits an audit event.** `treatment_plan.item_completed_without_note`
  fires whenever an item is completed; the timeline reconciles it with a
  follow-up `clinical_notes.treatment_created` event when the client
  captured a note. Don't bypass — the event is the only signal that an
  item was completed at all.
- **Don't import `clinical_notes`.** The dependency is one-way:
  `clinical_notes → treatment_plan`. The frontend calls both modules
  during completion; do not add a server-side cross-module import.
- **Auto-close cron lives here** (`tasks.py:auto_close_expired_plans`),
  not in budget — closing a plan is a treatment_plan write and budget
  is in this module's depends, so the read of `budgets` from the
  cron query is allowed.
