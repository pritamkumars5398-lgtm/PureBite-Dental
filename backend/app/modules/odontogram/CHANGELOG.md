# Changelog — odontogram module

## Unreleased

- feat(treatments): add ``crown_on_implant`` and
  ``provisional_crown_on_implant`` clinical types. Both render on the
  lateral view as a solid prosthetic fill on the crown path (same code
  path as ``bridge``) — the diagonal-stripes pattern used by regular
  ``crown`` looked too sparse / artificial for implant-supported
  restorations. The two new types appear in ``TreatmentPicker`` under
  the Restauradora category, and count as ``hasReplacementTreatment``
  so the underlying ``missing`` / ``extraction`` state stops fading
  the tooth.
- fix(ToothDualView): when a tooth carrying ``missing`` /
  ``extraction_indicated`` / ``extraction`` state receives a
  prosthetic replacement (implant, bridge, crown, pontic,
  bridge_abutment, overlay, inlay, unerupted), render the tooth at
  full opacity — the restoration supersedes the extracted state.
  Also suppress the dashed/solid X overlays (occlusal + lateral) on
  those teeth, so the X no longer paints over the implant/crown.
  Previously, SVG-level opacity (and the wrapper ``.transparent``
  0.4 dim) faded both the natural anatomy and every overlay, so a
  newly placed implant on an extracted tooth rendered almost
  invisible. Opacity now applies only to natural-anatomy paths and
  only when no replacement is present.
- fix(DiagnosisMode): hide treatments whose
  ``source_module === 'migration_import'`` from the Diagnóstico panel.
  Migrated patients arrived with their entire chart history (often
  decades of crowns, fillings and extractions) flooding the active
  diagnosis workflow. The artefacts remain visible on the odontogram
  via ``ToothRecord.general_condition``, and the historical record
  stays in the History tab + the auto-generated treatment plans.
- refactor(types): drop the ``as unknown as Record<string, unknown>`` cast in ``useTreatments`` now that ``useApi`` accepts ``object`` payloads.
- Added per-module `CLAUDE.md` for AI-agent context (2026-04-27).
- Issue #60: `DiagnosisMode.vue` exposes a right-rail
  `odontogram.diagnosis.sidebar` slot (with mobile slideover) and
  `ConditionsList.vue` exposes a per-treatment
  `odontogram.condition.actions` slot. The clinical_notes module fills
  both — odontogram itself does not depend on it.

## 0.3.0 — initial documented version

- Per-tooth state with surface granularity, JSONB-backed.
- Tooth treatment workflow with `added` / `status_changed` /
  `performed` / `deleted` events.
- Drives budget + treatment_plan sync via `odontogram.treatment.performed`.
